        Let's explain why the equals() method only compares the amount field:
1-Comparison of a Specific Field: 
How the equals() method works depends on how you override it. 
If you include code that only compares the amount field, the equals() method will only compare this field. 
For example:

        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) {
        return true;
        }
        
            if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
                return false;
            }
        
            Dollar dollar = (Dollar) obj;
            return this.amount == dollar.amount;
        }

2-This code means that the equals() method only compares the amount field. 
It only checks whether this field is equal.
Comparing Different Fields: If you want to consider other fields, 
you can add code to the equals() method to compare these fields as well. 
For example:

        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) {
        return true;
        }
        
            if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
                return false;
            }
        
            Dollar dollar = (Dollar) obj;
            return this.amount == dollar.amount && this.currency.equals(dollar.currency);
        }
3-This code ensures that both the amount and currency fields are compared. 
This way, all fields are checked to determine if two Dollar objects are equal.
Why Only amount?: Comparing only a specific field in a class depends on the class's purpose 
and the importance of these fields. 
For example, if the Dollar class is designed to assume that only the amount of money is important, 
then it makes sense for the equals() method to be designed to compare only the amount field. 
However, if all fields need to be compared, then the equals() method should be overridden appropriately.

In conclusion, how the equals() method is overridden entirely depends on the class design 
and what needs to be compared. If there are other fields in the Dollar class that need to be compared, 
then code should be added to the equals() method to compare these fields.
