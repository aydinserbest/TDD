    Gradually generalized the working code, replacing constants with variables.

    1.Using int amount = 10;:
    This statement does initialize amount with a constant value of 10,
    but in programming terms, amount itself is not a constant—it is a variable
    initialized with a constant value. The value 10 here acts like a literal
    or constant value because it doesn't change unless explicitly re-assigned in the code.
    The variable amount can still be modified later in the program.

    2.Using int amount;:
    This declaration indeed defines amount as a variable,
    but the key distinction here is that it's uninitialized.
    It signifies that amount is ready to store any integer value assigned to it later in the code.
    This state of being uninitialized doesn't inherently make amount a variable—it’s
    the ability to store and change values that does.

    More Accurate Explanation
    A more precise way to explain it might be:

    When you say int amount = 10;:
    You are declaring a variable amount and initializing it with a constant value of 10.
    The variable can hold different values over its lifetime, but it starts with 10.

    When you say int amount;: You are declaring a variable amount without initializing it.
    amount is ready to be assigned any integer value,
    and its value can be changed throughout the scope where it is declared.

    This distinction is important because, in programming,
    the terminology around constants and variables can have specific implications,
    especially when discussing code generalization and refactoring.
    In contexts like your original example, replacing specific literal values (like 10)
    with dynamic values that can change based on program logic or user input is
    a key part of making code more flexible and general.

    /*
    Original Situation
    In our original example,
    the Dollar class had a constant value initialized directly in its declaration with int amount = 10;.
    This is a constant because it starts every Dollar object with amount always being 10.

    Made Changes
    The generalization process:

    Using Variables: Instead of starting with a fixed value,
    the Dollar class's constructor (Dollar(int amount)) takes a parameter
    that allows the initialization value of amount to be set externally.
    This enables the creation of Dollar objects with different initial values,
    making the amount variable dynamic.
    Code Flexibility: The parameter taken in the constructor (amount)
    is assigned to the class’s internal amount variable (this.amount = amount;).
    This makes the initial state of the Dollar object dynamic depending on where it is instantiated.
    Dynamic Operations: The times method multiplies the amount value
    by a multiplier (this.amount *= multiplier;).
    This updates the amount value whenever the method is called,
    allowing the Dollar class to be used more generally and flexibly.
    These steps help make the code more general and reusable.
    Transitioning from constants to variables enhances the flexibility of the code,
    allowing it to function with a broad range of values and not just specific ones.
    This transformation ensures that the class’s functionality
    is not limited to predefined values, maintaining its utility across various scenarios.
