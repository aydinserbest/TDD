Copy-and-paste reuse? The death of abstraction? The killer of clean design?


1.Write a test. 
2. Make it compile. 
3. Run it to see that it fails. 
4. Make it run. 
5. Remove duplication. 


The different phases have different purposes. 
They call for different styles of solution, different aesthetic viewpoints. 

The first three phases need to go by quickly, so we get to a known state with the new functionality. 
We can commit any number of sins to get there, because speed trumps design, just for that brief moment.

The first four steps of the cycle wonâ€™t work without the fifth. 
Good design at good times. 
Make it run, make it right.
