The author discusses the idea of expanding the simple addition operations of the previous Money class. 
Here, the solution discussed involves creating an object 
that can encompass different currencies and represents the sum of two Money amounts.

his new object will essentially act like a Money 
but will actually represent the sum of two or more Money objects.

What Solution is Being Discussed?
Between the lines, the author discusses how multi-currency transactions will be represented and handled. 
Searching for a solution to manage transactions between different currencies. 
In this case, a simple Money object may not be sufficient 
because it needs to account for different currencies and their conversion.

Explanation of the Solution
The author's solution involves creating a new interface called Expression 
and extending the Money class to implement this interface. 
The Expression interface offers a structure that can represent amounts in different currencies 
and can conduct operations between these amounts. 
The Money class implements this interface, 
and another class or object (like Sum) that can represent the sum of two Money objects 
would also implement this interface.
This allows for flexible management of multi-currency transactions.Implementation Details
For example, you might want to sum amounts in two different currencies 
and then convert this sum to a reference currency.

This process can be managed by the Bank class:

    Bank bank = new Bank();
    Expression sum = new Sum(Money.dollar(5), Money.franc(10));
    Money result = bank.reduce(sum, "USD");  // Converts the total to USD

This example shows how the Sum class represents the sum of two Money objects, 
and the Bank class converts this sum to the desired currency.
The "solution" as defined by the author 
allows for cleaner and more understandable management of multi-currency transactions, 
offering more control and flexibility over the system. 
This is an example of TDD's evolutionary design approach, enhancing the code to better meet real-world needs.
