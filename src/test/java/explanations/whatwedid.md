explanation 1:

Step 1: Money Class and Basic Operations
Initially, you have the Money class, which represents amounts in a specific currency. One of the primary operations in this class is the plus method:


    public Money plus(Money addend) {
    return new Money(amount + addend.amount, currency);
    }
This operation sums two monetary amounts within the same currency and creates a new Money object. However, there is an issue here: it is only applicable within the same currency and does not support more complex transactions.

Step 2: Expression Interface and Sum Class
To support more complex transactions between different currencies, we introduced an interface named Expression. This interface is used to represent transactions across various currencies. The Money class implements this interface, and the plus method now needs to return an Expression. Therefore, we need to update the plus method in the Money class:


    public Expression plus(Money addend) {
    return new Sum(this, addend);
    }
The Sum class represents the total of two Money objects and implements the Expression interface. This allows for the capability to sum two different currencies.

Step 3: Details of the Sum Class
In the Sum class, two Money objects, augend and addend, are stored. These two fields are used for the sum operation:


    class Sum implements Expression {
    Money augend;
    Money addend;

    public Sum(Money augend, Money addend) {
        this.augend = augend;
        this.addend = addend;
    }

    public Money reduce(String to) {
        int amount = augend.amount + addend.amount;
        return new Money(amount, to);
    }
}
Step 4: Bank Class and Conversion Operations
The Bank class has the ability to perform conversions between different currencies. The reduce method takes an Expression and converts it according to a specified currency:


    public Money reduce(Expression source, String to) {
    return source.reduce(to);
    }
This method performs the operation based on the type of Expression using polymorphism, meaning it could be Money or Sum, both of which implement the reduce method.

Step 5: Polymorphism and Cleaner Code
To make our code cleaner, we defined the reduce method in the Expression interface, and each class implements its own version of this method. This allows us to call the appropriate reduce method directly without needing type checking:


    interface Expression {
    Money reduce(String to);
    }
In this way, in the Bank class's reduce method, we can call the reduce method directly without any type checks.

These steps help you understand how each component in the system is interconnected and how they function as a whole. Each step moves the system towards a broader framework and enables us to better simulate real-world scenarios. By building this structure, you can see how each part integrates with others and how the system is expanded.



explanation 2:

Step 1: Enhancing the Plus Method
First, let's address the operation of summing two Money objects. Currently, the plus method directly sums the amounts of two Money objects and creates a new Money object. However, we realized that this needs to utilize a more general structure, the Expression interface, to represent the result of the summation. Thus, we update the plus method to return an Expression instead of Money. This allows the result of the summation to be returned as a Sum object:


    public Expression plus(Money addend) {
    return new Sum(this, addend);
    }
Step 2: Defining the Sum Class
The Sum class contains two Money objects and represents their total. This class includes two fields, augend (the number being added to) and addend (the number added), and also implements the Expression interface, allowing operations on different Expression types:


    class Sum implements Expression {
    Money augend;
    Money addend;

    public Sum(Money augend, Money addend) {
        this.augend = augend;
        this.addend = addend;
    }
}
Step 3: Enhancing the Reduce Method in the Bank Class
The reduce method in the Bank class takes an Expression object and converts it according to the desired currency. If the Expression is a Sum, we sum the amounts of augend and addend and create a new Money object:


    public Money reduce(Expression source, String to) {
    if (source instanceof Sum) {
    Sum sum = (Sum) source;
    int amount = sum.augend.amount + sum.addend.amount;
    return new Money(amount, to);
    }
    return (Money) source;
    }
Step 4: Refactoring Using Polymorphism
To make our code cleaner and more modular, we can define the reduce method inside the Sum class. Thus, the Bank class only calls the reduce method, and the details of the operation are handled by the Sum class:


    public Money reduce(Expression source, String to) {
    return source.reduce(to);
    }
Both the Sum and Money classes implement the reduce method internally:


    public Money reduce(String to) {
    int totalAmount = augend.amount + addend.amount;
    return new Money(totalAmount, to);
    }
Step 5: Updating and Adding New Tests
To validate these new structures, we should add new tests that check the reduce method of the Bank class and ensure that Money objects are correctly converted. Additionally, we should add tests that verify a Sum object is correctly created and processed.

These steps are excellent examples of iterative development and continuous refactoring practices in the TDD process. Each step enhances the abstraction in the system and improves the code's flexibility and testability, helping you build a more robust and flexible architecture.
