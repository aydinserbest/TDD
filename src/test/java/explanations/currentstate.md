Current State
As of now, the introduction of the Expression interface and the Sum class are significant steps towards integrating the capability to perform operations between different currencies into the system. However, these structures are not yet fully equipped to handle conversions between different currencies. This is because the TDD approach progresses in small, incremental steps; each step prepares the groundwork for the next, more complex challenges.

Future Steps
As per the TDD approach taken by the author, it is expected that future steps will include mechanisms necessary to manage transactions between different currencies. This typically involves:

Adding Exchange Rates: Incorporating a structure to hold exchange rate information into the system. This structure should contain the necessary rates to facilitate conversions between different currencies.
Integration of Conversion Operations: Enhancing the Bank class with the ability to perform conversions between different currencies. This enhancement often involves expanding the Bank class's reduce method to include exchange rate information.
Adding Complex Test Scenarios: Introducing new test scenarios to test conversions between different currencies. These tests are critical in verifying that the system functions correctly and can perform the expected conversions accurately.
Conclusion
These steps gradually expand the functionality within the system and make it more suitable for real-world scenarios. The "slow but sure steps" approach of TDD helps to reduce errors in the software development process, better understand requirements, and create a more robust software architecture. By following this method, the author lays the foundation for the system to eventually handle transactions between different currencies seamlessly.
