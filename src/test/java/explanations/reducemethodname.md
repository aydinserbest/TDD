The reasoning behind the name of the reduce method in the Bank class, 
especially in the context of TDD and software design, could be connected 
to its usage in financial terminology. 

The term "reduce" typically means to simplify or convert something into a more manageable or simpler form. 
In the context of TDD and software architecture, 
the purpose of the reduce method is to "reduce" an Expression object, 
which may involve multiple currencies or complex currency operations, 
down to a single standard currency. 

This method is often used to simplify transactions or calculations involving multiple currencies.

Rationale for the reduce Method from a Testing and Structural Perspective

Management of Multiple Currencies:
The reduce method in the Bank class is used to reduce complex financial expressions 
involving multiple currencies to a single currency. This is crucial in systems that handle global transactions or financial operations across different countries.

Testability:
The reduce method facilitates testing the accuracy of the software 
by converting the results of operations involving different currencies into the correct currency and amount. 
For instance, after performing an addition with different currencies, 
you can use the reduce method to ensure the outcome is correctly converted, 
testing the currency conversion logic of the system.

Simplification and Generalization:
The reduce method simplifies currency operations within the system 
by converting complex currency expressions or calculations into a more general and understandable format. 
This allows other components of the system to operate without considering currency conversions, 
promoting modularity and reusability of the code.

Consolidation:
In financial systems, especially in areas like portfolio management or accounting, 
it is often necessary to consolidate the outcomes of numerous different transactions 
or calculations into one standard currency. 
The reduce method is designed to effectively perform such consolidation.
In summary, the name of the reduce method reflects its function in TDD 
and software design as a tool to simplify complex financial operations into a simpler, 
more manageable, and testable structure. This method ensures consistency 
and accuracy across the system by reducing inter-currency transactions to a single reference currency.
