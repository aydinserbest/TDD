Simple Addition Test
Initially, we saw an example of how to sum two amounts in the same currency. 
This test calls the plus method of the Money class to add two Money objects 
and checks if the result is of the expected value.

    public void testSimpleAddition() {
    Money sum = Money.dollar(5).plus(Money.dollar(5));
    assertEquals(Money.dollar(10), sum);
    }
Here, two Money objects each worth 5 dollars are added, 
and a Money object worth 10 dollars is expected as a result.

Definition of the Plus Method
The plus method is defined to sum two amounts. 
This method sums the current amount and the added amount to create a new Money object. 
This new object contains the total amount and the current currency.

More Complex Expressions and the Expression Interface
When the need arises to conduct transactions between different currencies, 
the Money class may not be sufficient. 
Instead, an interface called Expression is defined. 
Expression is a more general concept for monetary transactions, 
and Money implements this interface.Bank Class and Currency Conversion
To convert between different currencies, a class called Bank is introduced. 
The Bank class is used to convert Expressions from one currency to another. 
This can be used, for example, to reduce a sum operation to a single currency during a reduction process.

    public void testSimpleAddition() {
    Money five = Money.dollar(5);
    Expression sum = five.plus(five);
    Bank bank = new Bank();
    Money reduced = bank.reduce(sum, "USD");
    assertEquals(Money.dollar(10), reduced);
    }
Here, the plus method returns an Expression, 
and the Bank class reduces this expression to the desired currency (USD).
Simple and Understandable Concepts
Money: A class that represents an amount and a currency.
Expression: A general interface for transactions between currencies. Money implements this interface.
Bank: A class that can perform conversions between different currencies.
In the TDD process, you start by writing a simple test. 
The minimal necessary code is written to pass this test. 
Then, the code is refined to handle more realistic and complex situations. 
During this process, the design of the software is considered, 
and design changes are made as needed. 
This approach ensures that the software is developed step-by-step 
while continuously verifying its functionality.
