how the Sum class's reduce method works and the processes it performs:

Sum Class's reduce Method
The reduce method defined in the Sum class sums the amounts contained in two Money objects that are stored within the Sum instance. This method then returns a new Money object in the specified currency (in this case, "USD"). Here is the implementation of this method:


    public Money reduce(String to) {
    int amount = augend.amount + addend.amount;
    return new Money(amount, to);
    }
How the Method Works
Addition Process: The augend and addend are the two Money objects contained within the Sum instance. The amount values of these two Money objects (augend.amount and addend.amount) are summed in the reduce method. This addition operation numerically combines the values of the two Money objects.
Creating a New Money Object: The total amount (amount) calculated in the reduce method is used to create a new Money object. This object is initiated with the specified currency (to). The expression new Money(amount, to) creates a new Money object that contains the total amount and the designated currency.
Example Scenario
In your example, a Sum object is created using Money.dollar(3) and Money.dollar(4). When the reduce method is called, the following occurs:

The amounts of augend.amount (3) and addend.amount (4) are summed, resulting in a total of 7.
A new Money object is created using new Money(7, "USD"), with an amount of 7 and currency "USD".
When this method is called from the Bank class, it performs a conversion to the desired currency and returns a Money object as a result. This process demonstrates that the Sum object successfully summed the two Money objects and converted this total into a Money object in the desired currency. This operation fulfills the requirements of the Expression interface and concretely demonstrates how polymorphism works in practice.
