the necessity and impact of adding the Expression interface and the Sum class on the system, highlighting how these additions enhance system flexibility and support for more complex currency operations:

Situation Before Adding Expression Interface and Sum Class
Single Currency Transactions:
Initially, our Money class could only handle transactions in the same currency type. For example, it could only add dollars to dollars or francs to francs. This was straightforwardly accomplished using the Money class's plus method:


        public Money plus(Money addend) {
        return new Money(amount + addend.amount, currency);
        }
However, this method did not support more complex operations, such as summing different currencies.

Limited Functionality:
Using only the Money class, it was not possible to perform transactions between different currencies. This limitation hindered our ability to accurately model real-world scenarios like global trade or multinational operations.

Situation After Adding Expression Interface and Sum Class
Ability to Transact Across Different Currencies:
The Expression interface enables transactions between different currencies. Both Money and Sum classes implement this interface, allowing any currency expression within the system to be evaluated. For instance, the sum of one dollar and one franc can be represented as a Sum object:


        Money dollar = Money.dollar(1);
        Money franc = Money.franc(1);
        Expression sum = new Sum(dollar, franc);
Flexible Conversion and Computation Capability:
The Sum class aggregates the amounts of two Money objects it contains and can convert them into the desired currency. This is facilitated using the Bank class's reduce method. For example:


    Bank bank = new Bank();
    Money result = bank.reduce(sum, "USD");  // Converts the Sum object into USD
This process allows for flexible conversions between different currencies.

Cleaner Code through Polymorphism:
Thanks to the Expression interface, different currency expressions (such as Money and Sum) can be consolidated under the same interface. This reduces the need for type checking and makes the code cleaner. Each expression type (Money or Sum) implements its own reduce method, thus the Bank class can directly call the reduce method regardless of the source type:


    Money reducedMoney = bank.reduce(moneyExpression, "USD");
    Money reducedSum = bank.reduce(sumExpression, "USD");
This structure makes currency transactions within the system more modular and understandable.

With these additions, our system becomes more capable of effectively managing transactions between different currencies, enhancing the realism of simulating global financial scenarios.

the significance of adding the Expression interface and the Sum class, along with detailed examples of the advantages these structures provide:

1. Before the Expression Interface and Sum Class
   Initially, the Money class's plus method only added two Money objects under the same currency, returning a new Money object. This setup did not allow for operations across different currencies, limiting all transactions within a single currency framework.

For example:


    public Money plus(Money addend) {
    return new Money(amount + addend.amount, currency);
    }
This approach works well when operating with the same currencies but does not support transactions between different currencies. For instance, a transaction like $5 USD + 10 CHF was not possible because the system lacked the capability to automatically convert between different currencies.

2. Supporting Transactions Across Different Currencies
   The addition of the Expression interface and the Sum class enables the capability to support transactions between different currencies. The Expression interface allows different types of financial expressions (such as Money and Sum) to be consolidated under the same interface. This arrangement enables the Bank class to convert different expressions into a single currency.

For example:


        public Expression plus(Money addend) {
        return new Sum(this, addend);
        }
This code combines two Money objects into a Sum, allowing the Bank class to convert this Sum expression into the desired currency.

3. Complex Currency Transactions
   The Sum class contains two different Money objects (augend and addend). This class allows for the combination of these two objects, performing a sum operation which enables more complex currency transactions.

For example:


    class Sum implements Expression {
    Money augend; // First addend
    Money addend; // Second addend

    public Money reduce(String to) {
        int totalAmount = augend.amount + addend.amount; // Sums the amounts
        return new Money(totalAmount, to); // Converts to a new currency
    }
    }
This structure, for example, calculates and converts the sum of $3 USD + $4 USD to a total of $7 USD. Additionally, when performing a transaction like $5 USD + 10 CHF using conversion rates, it can calculate this total based on a specific exchange rate and convert it to the desired currency.

In conclusion, the addition of the Expression interface and the Sum class allows our system to operate flexibly and effectively across different currencies, supports more complex financial operations, and generally expands the capabilities of our system. Without these structures, the system could only perform simple, single-currency transactions and could not manage conversions between different currencies.
