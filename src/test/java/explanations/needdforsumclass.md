    Expression sum= new Sum(Money.dollar(3), Money.dollar(4));
    Bank bank= new Bank();
    Money result= bank.reduce(sum, "USD");

explanation 1:

1. Creating a Sum Object
   
        new Sum(Money.dollar(3), Money.dollar(4));
   This expression creates a Sum object using two Money objects (Money.dollar(3) and Money.dollar(4)). Here, the Sum object represents an expression composed of these two dollar amounts combined. Thus, the Sum object represents a total value of 7 dollars, as it sums 3 dollars and 4 dollars.

2. Bank Class and the Reduce Method
   
        Bank bank = new Bank();
   This expression creates an object of the Bank class. The reduce method of the Bank object is used to convert an Expression (in this case, a Sum object) into a specific currency (here, "USD").


    bank.reduce(sum, "USD");
In this line, you are calling the reduce method of the bank object, passing the previously created Sum object and the target currency "USD". The reduce method sums the two Money amounts in the Sum object and returns a new Money object in the specified currency.

3. How the Reduce Method Works
   Let's take a closer look at how the Bank class's reduce method operates. Suppose the reduce method is implemented as follows:


    public Money reduce(Expression source, String to) {
    if (source instanceof Sum) {
    Sum sum = (Sum) source;
    int totalAmount = sum.augend.amount + sum.addend.amount;
    return new Money(totalAmount, to);
    }
    return null; // This handles other types of Expressions that might come through.
    }
This piece of code checks if the source parameter is a Sum type Expression. If so, it sums the amounts of the two Money objects contained within the Sum (augend and addend) and creates a new Money object. The amount of this new Money object is the total amount, and the currency is taken from the second parameter of the method (to).

4. Result
   In this example, the expressions Money.dollar(3) and Money.dollar(4) within the Sum object are summed, and as a result, a Money object valued at 7 USD is returned. While this operation could also be performed with different currencies, in your example, both Money objects are already denominated in "USD", allowing for direct summation.

This process helps you better understand the role and interaction of classes like Bank and Sum. It lays the groundwork for handling more complex transactions involving different currencies.

explanation 2:

Step 1: Creating a Sum Object
First, you are creating a Sum object by summing two Money objects:


      Sum sum = new Sum(Money.dollar(3), Money.dollar(4));
In this line, amounts of three and four dollars are combined within a Sum object. Here, the Sum object represents the total of these two Money objects. Since the Sum class implements the Expression interface, this total is also considered an Expression.

Step 2: Using the Bank Class and the reduce Method
Next, you create a Bank object and call its reduce method:


      Bank bank = new Bank();
      Money result = bank.reduce(sum, "USD");
In this part, you pass two parameters to the reduce method: sum and "USD". sum is the Sum object you created earlier; "USD" is the currency you want the result converted to.

Step 3: How the reduce Method Works
The reduce method performs a conversion using the Expression type sum object and the target currency ("USD"). The key here is that the sum object is of the Sum class, and how this class implements its reduce method within:


      public Money reduce(Expression source, String to) {
      if (source instanceof Sum) {
      Sum sum = (Sum) source;
      return sum.reduce(to);
      }
      ...
      }
The reduce method of the Bank class checks the type of the source object (here, Sum). If it is Sum, it calls Sum's own reduce method. The reduce method of Sum sums the amounts of the two Money objects it contains and creates a new Money object in the desired currency ("USD"):


    public Money reduce(String to) {
    int totalAmount = augend.amount + addend.amount;
    return new Money(totalAmount, to);
    }
In this example, augend.amount (3 dollars) and addend.amount (4 dollars) are summed, resulting in a new Money object valued at 7 dollars. This operation is straightforward because both Money objects are already in "USD". However, if different currencies were involved, a currency conversion would have been necessary at this point.

Conclusion
This process demonstrates how the Sum and Bank classes work together and how a conversion mechanism for transactions between different currencies could be established. The reduce method simplifies complex currency operations by converting values into the desired currency.
