The simple application defined under the "Multi-Currency Money" heading serves 
as an example of designing a financial reporting system capable of handling multiple currencies. 

The application is designed to manage the quantities, unit prices, 
and total values of financial instruments in various currencies.

The application's functions include:

1-Adding and Converting Different Currencies: 
The application should combine amounts in different currencies and convert the results 
using specified exchange rates. 
For instance, IBM and Novartis shares are listed in different currencies (USD and CHF), 
and the report needs to calculate their equivalents in USD.

2-Multiplying Quantities to Calculate Total Value: 
The application should multiply a stock's unit price by the number of shares owned to calculate the total value.
Such an application is useful for companies operating internationally and in global markets. 
It can be used for reporting and financial analysis, 
serving as a fundamental tool for financial systems dealing with multiple currencies. 
The application's development uses the TDD approach, 
with functional requirements validated and the code's correctness tested at each step.

The "$5 * 2 = $10" example in the text illustrates this approach. 
The author states that when a Dollar object's value is multiplied by two, 
the expected result (10) should be achieved. 
This test starts with a simple code snippet that isn't fully functional yet 
(for example, missing the Dollar class). 
However, it emphasizes that the test's failure (red bar) indicates progress in the development process.
