"Side-effect free" refers to a function or method operating 
without altering the state of the program or affecting any external data. 
In programming, side-effect-free methods are typically considered cleaner, more predictable, 
and less prone to errors. These types of methods, prevalent in functional programming paradigms, 
operate by evaluating their inputs and producing outputs without changing anything externally.

        public class Dollar {
    int amount;

    Dollar(int amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    Dollar times(int multiplier) {
        return new Dollar(amount * multiplier);
    }
    }

Preservation of the Original Object: 
In this code, the times method does not alter the amount value of the original Dollar object when called. 
Instead, it returns a new Dollar object with an amount value multiplied by the multiplier. 
This approach ensures that the state of the original object remains unchanged, 
indicating that the method is side-effect-free.

Prevention of Side Effects: 
In the previous version (void times(int multiplier) { amount *= multiplier; }), 
calling the times method would permanently modify the amount value of the original Dollar object. 
This means the method is side-effecting as the call changes the state of the object. 
This can lead to the object behaving unpredictably, 
especially if accessed by multiple operations or threads.
Clarity in Tests: Using the side-effect-free times method also leads to clearer outcomes in tests. 
Since each times call generates a new object, we can handle each test case in an isolated manner. 
This ensures that tests are more predictable and repeatable. 
For example, after defining Dollar five = new Dollar(5);, each subsequent times call 
does not alter the state of the five object, 
thus preventing errors due to side effects between different tests.
In conclusion, side-effect-free programming practices help make the software more robust and easier 
to maintain. 
Ensuring functions and methods are side-effect-free can simplify debugging and fixing issues 
in large, complex systems, while also enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the software.
