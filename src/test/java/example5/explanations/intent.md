When a person reading the test code examines the line assertEquals(new Dollar(10), product);, 
they understand that this test verifies that the Dollar class's times method functions correctly 
by comparing the values of objects. 
This test line checks whether the product object, which is the result of the five.times(2) call, 
is equal to a new Dollar object with a value of 10. The expected result here is that 
the five object, when multiplied by 2, returns a Dollar object with a value of 10.

Expected Result:

The Dollar object obtained as a result of the five.times(2) expression 
should be equal in value to a Dollar object with a value of 10. 
This demonstrates that the times method correctly multiplies the amount value 
by the given multiplier and creates a new Dollar object.

If we had used the expression assertEquals(10, product.amount);, 
this test would have checked if the product.amount value was directly equal to 10. 
However, this approach would be less suitable for object-oriented programming principles because:

Encapsulation Violation: Direct access to an internal property 
like product.amount violates the principle of encapsulation. 
Instead of exposing the internal structure of the Dollar class, i.e., the amount property, 
it is healthier to evaluate the object as a whole.
Loss of Meaning: 
The expression assertEquals(10, product.amount); 
evaluates the test's purpose and object equality check based solely on a number, 
which can overshadow the broader importance of the equality of Dollar objects.
Sensitivity to Future Changes: 
If changes are made to the structure of the Dollar class (e.g., adding other properties), 
the assertEquals(10, product.amount); expression would only consider the amount property,
which could quickly render this test invalid.
Consequently, the expression assertEquals(new Dollar(10), product); 
is preferred because it tests the functionality of the Dollar class 
and the correctness of the times method in a way that aligns with object-oriented principles 
and clearly conveys its intent.

Let's examine the line assertEquals(new Dollar(10), product);:

This test line checks if the result of the five.times(2) call 
is equal to a new Dollar object worth 10 dollars. 
This confirms that the times method of the Dollar class is working correctly 
and produces the right result when multiplied by a specific multiplier.

Why is assertEquals(10, product.amount); Not Sufficient?
If we wrote assertEquals(10, product.amount);, 
this test would only check the value of the amount property of the product object. 
In this case:

The test focuses only on the amount value, 
ignoring other possible properties or states of the Dollar object.
The test does not validate the equality definition and correct behavior of the Dollar object. 
It does not address how the Dollar class should behave as a whole.
It violates important concepts like object-oriented design principles and encapsulation 
because it directly accesses the internal state of the object. 
This creates dependency on the internal states of objects in larger and more complex systems, 
making code maintenance more challenging.
Advantages of Using assertEquals(new Dollar(10), product);

This statement tests that the Dollar object is correctly created and processed. 
Using the equals method of the Dollar class, it evaluates the entire state of the object.
The test focuses on the design of the Dollar class and object equality, offering a healthier 
and more comprehensive validation.
It provides more information about the Dollar class and its methods 
because it demonstrates how the Dollar object should be used and how interactions 
between objects should occur.
In conclusion, the assertEquals(new Dollar(10), product); 
statement reflects both the behavior of the object and the design principles correctly. 
This clearly communicates to the code reader what the test aims to verify and the expected results. 
This approach contributes to making the code more understandable and maintainable.
