Let's go through each evolution of the test to see 
how it became more "speaking" (expressive) and how it more clearly communicates what it is testing.
1. First Version

        public class Dollar {
           int amount;
        
           Dollar(int amount) {
           this.amount = amount;
           }
        
           void times(int multiplier) {
           amount *= multiplier;
           }
           }
        
        public class MultiplyTest {
        @Test
        public void testMultiplication() {
        Dollar five = new Dollar(5);
        five.times(2);
        assertEquals(10, five.amount);
        five.times(3);
        assertEquals(15, five.amount);
        }
        }



Analysis:

This test tries to confirm that the Dollar class's times method changes the amount property.
Before the five.times(3); call, five.amount was already 10 (after the first times(2) call).
In the second call, this value is multiplied by three, hence the result becomes 30. 
The test fails because it expected 15.
The expressiveness of the test is low; 
it only validates numerical values and 
it's not clear how the times method affects the object. 
Moreover, it's difficult to follow each step of the operation chain 
that the test wants to validate, 
making it hard to understand what the test is checking.

2.Second Version

        public class Dollar {
           int amount;
        
           Dollar(int amount) {
           this.amount = amount;
           }
        
           Dollar times(int multiplier) {
           return new Dollar(amount * multiplier);
           }
           }
        
        // Test Class
        Dollar five = new Dollar(5);
        Dollar product = five.times(2);
        assertEquals(10, product.amount);
        product = five.times(3);
        assertEquals(15, product.amount);


Analysis:

The times method now returns a new Dollar object and does not modify the original object. 
This shows that the method is side-effect free, which is generally a cleaner programming practice.
The tests are still based on numerical values. assertEquals still checks the amount property, 
so it's not fully in line with object encapsulation.
3. Third Version

                public class Dollar {
               int amount;
            
               Dollar(int amount) {
               this.amount = amount;
               }
            
               Dollar times(int multiplier) {
               return new Dollar(amount * multiplier);
               }
            
               public boolean equals(Object object) {
               Dollar dollar = (Dollar) object;
               return amount == dollar.amount;
               }
               }
            
            // Test Class
            public class MultiplyTest {
            @Test
            public void testMultiplication() {
            Dollar five = new Dollar(5);
            Dollar product = five.times(2);
            assertEquals(10, product.amount);
            product = five.times(3);
            assertEquals(15, product.amount);
            }

    @Test
    public void testEquality() {
        assertTrue(new Dollar(5).equals(new Dollar(5)));
    }
}




Analysis:

An equals method has been added, allowing validation based on object equality.
However, the testMultiplication still relies on amount values for testing. 
This means it's not fully appropriate for encapsulation and object-oriented approach.
4. Fourth Version
    
        public class Dollar {
           int amount;
        
           Dollar(int amount) {
           this.amount = amount;
           }
        
           Dollar times(int multiplier) {
           return new Dollar(amount * multiplier);
           }
        
           public boolean equals(Object object) {
           Dollar dollar = (Dollar) object;
           return amount == dollar.amount;
           }
           }
        
        public class MultiplyTest {
        @Test
        public void testMultiplication() {
        Dollar five = new Dollar(5);
        assertEquals(new Dollar(10), five.times(2));
        assertEquals(new Dollar(15), five.times(3));
        }
        }




Analysis:

This final version very clearly expresses the intent and meaning of the tests. 
We are now directly checking the equality of Dollar objects, 
which correctly reflects the use of the equals method and object encapsulation.
The tests explicitly state the expected results (new Dollar(10) and new Dollar(15)) 
and validate the functionality of the Dollar class directly through objects. 
This makes the tests "speaking" because it clearly communicates to the reader 
what the test is checking and what the expected outcomes are.
