1-These four distinct evolutionary stages illustrate the development of the Dollar class and its tests, 
and how they transitioned towards better test writing. 
Let's analyze each one, considering how "speaking" they are, that is, 
how clearly they communicate to someone reading the code what the test is checking 
and what the expected outcomes are:

First Evolutionary Stage
Code:
       
         public class Dollar {
        int amount;
        Dollar(int amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
        }
        void times(int multiplier) {
        amount *= multiplier;
        }
        }
        public class MultiplyTest {
        @Test
        public void testMultiplication() {
        Dollar five = new Dollar(5);
        five.times(2);
        assertEquals(10, five.amount);
        five.times(3);
        assertEquals(15, five.amount);
        }
        }

Error:

        java.lang.AssertionError:
        Expected :15
        Actual   :30


Explanation:
This test misuses the times method of the Dollar class. 
The method modifies the object's own amount value, 
which causes the second assertEquals call to produce an incorrect result (30). 
Since the five object is multiplied twice, the expected value turns out to be 30 instead of 15. 
This approach does not clearly convey what the test is checking and could be misleading.

Second Evolutionary Stage
Code:

            public class Dollar {
    int amount;
    Dollar(int amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
    }
    Dollar times(int multiplier) {
        return new Dollar(amount * multiplier);
    }
    }
    public class MultiplyTest {
    @Test
    public void testMultiplication() {
    Dollar five = new Dollar(5);
    Dollar product = five.times(2);
    assertEquals(10, product.amount);
    product = five.times(3);
    assertEquals(15, product.amount);
    }
    }

In this version, 
the times method returns a new Dollar object. 
This preserves the original state of the five object. 
However, numerical comparison is still being done using product.amount. 
While this test is more understandable, directly comparing the values of Dollar objects 
would have been better.

Third Evolutionary Stage
Code:

    public class Dollar {
    int amount;
    Dollar(int amount) {
    this.amount = amount;
    }
    Dollar times(int multiplier) {
    return new Dollar(amount * multiplier);
    }
    public boolean equals(Object object) {
    Dollar dollar = (Dollar) object;
    return amount == dollar.amount;
    }
    }
    public class MultiplyTest {
    @Test
    public void testMultiplication() {
    Dollar five = new Dollar(5);
    Dollar product = five.times(2);
    assertEquals(10, product.amount);
    product = five.times(3);
    assertEquals(15, product.amount);
    }
    @Test
    public void testEquality() {
    assertTrue(new Dollar(5).equals(new Dollar(5)));
    }
    }

At this stage, the equals method has been added, 
yet product.amount is still being used. 
The addition of the testEquality test now ensures the equality check for Dollar objects. 
However, for the testMultiplication to be "speaking," it needs to perform comparisons 
based on object instances.

Fourth Evolutionary Stage
Code:


        public class Dollar {
        int amount;
        Dollar(int amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
        }
        Dollar times(int multiplier) {
        return new Dollar(amount * multiplier);
        }
        public boolean equals(Object object) {
        Dollar dollar = (Dollar) object;
        return amount == dollar.amount;
        }
        }
        public class MultiplyTest {
        @Test
        public void testMultiplication() {
        Dollar five = new Dollar(5);
        assertEquals(new Dollar(10), five.times(2));
        assertEquals(new Dollar(15), five.times(3));
        }
        }

Explanation:
In this final stage, the tests have become much more "speaking." 
The tests use direct comparison of Dollar objects to clearly 
and explicitly express the expected outcome of the times method. 
This best communicates to the person reading the code what is being tested 
and what the expected outcomes are.

In conclusion, each evolutionary stage represents a step towards making the tests more explanatory 
and understandable. 
This, in turn, enhances the readability and maintainability of the test code.
