###

the functionality of the code with concrete examples:

Multiplication Calculation: 
Suppose a person has $5. This individual wants to triple their money. 
The system calculates that multiplying $5 by 3 results in a total of $15.

Currency Comparison: 
Two people want to check if they have the same amount of money. 
The first person has $10, while the second person has 10 Swiss Francs. 
The system compares these amounts and indicates that they are not equal 
because they are in different currencies.

Currency Query: 
A user wants to know the currency of the money they hold. 
When the user queries the system for an amount of $1, the system confirms that this amount is in dollars.

These examples illustrate how the code performs basic money operations and currency queries. 
Each operation can be easily executed through the classes and methods defined in the code.
