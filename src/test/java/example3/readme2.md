Let's walk through how the author's concerns about public fields, side effects, and integers for monetary amounts 
are addressed and transformed throughout the progression of the Dollar class in Chapters 1 and 2:

Public Fields:
    -Initial State: In the initial implementation, the Dollar class has an amount field 
defined as a public integer:

        public class Dollar {
        int amount = 10;
        }

This public field can be directly accessed and modified, which is a design concern 
as it allows uncontrolled changes to the object's state.
    -Progression: The later version of the Dollar class introduces a private constructor parameter 
to initialize amount:

        public class Dollar {
        int amount;
        Dollar(int amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
        }
        }

This partially addresses the public field concern by allowing amount to be set through a controlled mechanism, 
although amount is still accessible directly from outside the class.
    -Further Improvement: The final version retains this constructor and also includes a times method that returns a new Dollar object:

        Dollar times(int multiplier) {
        return new Dollar(this.amount * multiplier);
        }


This change ensures that any operation on the Dollar object does not directly modify its internal state, 
which reduces potential issues arising from public fields.
    
-Side Effects:
    -Initial State: Initially, the times method modifies the amount field directly

        void times(int multiplier) {
        this.amount *= multiplier;
        }


This creates a side effect, 
as the state of the Dollar object is altered directly by the times method, leading to potential unintended behaviors.
    -Progression: The final version of the times method now returns a new Dollar object:

        Dollar times(int multiplier) {
        return new Dollar(this.amount * multiplier);
        }


This design eliminates side effects by ensuring that each operation creates a new object 
rather than modifying the current one. 
This transition reflects a key theme of TDD: translating concerns like side effects 
into concrete tests and addressing them through iterative development.

-Integers for Monetary Amounts:
    -Initial State: The initial implementation directly assigns an integer to the amount field:

        int amount = 10;

This demonstrates a concern about using integers for monetary amounts, 
as floating-point arithmetic might be more appropriate to handle cents and other fractional values in a real-world application.

Remaining Issues: 
Throughout Chapter 1 and 2, the implementation still uses integers to manage monetary amounts, 
which reflects a compromise made for simplicity during the initial development process.

Potential Further Development: 
In later stages or refinements, this could be addressed by switching to a more precise data type, such as BigDecimal, 
to handle monetary amounts accurately, particularly in a real-world application.

Summary:
Overall, the evolution of the Dollar class in Chapters 1 and 2 demonstrates 
how TDD addresses public fields, side effects, and integer-based monetary amounts:

Public fields are initially present, then addressed partially through a controlled constructor.
Side effects from direct state modification are eliminated by making the times method return a new Dollar object.
Integers remain used for simplicity, but further refinements could address this concern.
The iterative nature of TDD and the refactoring process help mitigate these issues over time, 
transforming the design into a more robust and functional solution.
