The author explains the two main strategies used in the Test-Driven Development (TDD) process and how to transition between them. 
In summary, the key points are:

Summary of Chapter 1: 
In the first chapter, the "Fake It" strategy was employed by writing a fake implementation first 
and gradually replacing the fake code with real code.

Two Main Strategies: Two main strategies can be applied in the TDD process:

Fake It: 
We first write a fake implementation that returns constant values, 
then gradually replace these constants with variables to reach real code.

Obvious Implementation: 
We write the real implementation directly, meaning we write and run the actual code once we know what it should do.

Transitioning Between Strategies: 
The author notes that they shift between these two strategies in the TDD process. 
They write and test a code they believe to be correct directly. 
If the test passes, they proceed to the next step. 
However, in case of an unexpected failure (a red bar), they step back and revert to the "Fake It" strategy, 
writing a fake implementation that gradually transforms into real code.

Design Discussions: 
The author also discusses how TDD affects design discussions. 
By translating aesthetic judgments, like side effects, into tests, it becomes possible to discuss real functionality. 
Once there is agreement on how the system should function, discussions can shift to how to best implement that functionality.

In conclusion, the author describes how the TDD process works, the transition between the two main strategies, 
and how this process makes design discussions more focused and concrete.

reflecting the TDD strategies and improvements we made:

Initial State and the "Fake It" Strategy
Initially, the Dollar class was initialized with a constant amount value, and the times method didnâ€™t perform any operation. 
Our first test (testMultiplication) simply tested this constant value. 
This aligns with the author's "Fake It" strategy, as we started with a temporary solution rather than a real implementation:

public class Dollar {
int amount = 10;
Dollar(int amount) {
}
void times(int multiplier) {
}
}

The "Obvious Implementation" Strategy and Improvements
Later, we updated the times method to multiply the amount value by a multiplier. 
This exemplifies the author's "Obvious Implementation" strategy because 
we directly coded the expected functionality to pass our tests:

public class Dollar {
int amount;
Dollar(int amount) {
this.amount = amount;
}
void times(int multiplier) {
this.amount *= multiplier;
}
}


Expanding Tests and Addressing Side Effects
We then expanded our tests and found that 
the times method permanently changed the state of the Dollar object each time it was called. 
This is an example of how tests can reveal side effects, as the author mentioned. 
Our tests demonstrated that the method didn't reflect the expected behavior, 
prompting us to redesign the times method to eliminate these side effects:

public class Dollar {
int amount;
Dollar(int amount) {
this.amount = amount;
}
Dollar times(int multiplier) {
return new Dollar(this.amount * multiplier);
}
}


Design Discussions and Further Refinements
This change ensures that the state of the Dollar object remains unchanged after calling the times method, 
fulfilling the author's theme of "translating aesthetic judgments into tests." 
We were then able to discuss how our system should function and subsequently how to best implement that behavior.

In summary, we implemented the author's TDD strategies and design improvements in our code through our modifications. 
This process led to more robust code and reliable tests, improving our software development workflow.
