Introducing a Factory Method
To reduce direct references to subclasses,
a factory method (Money.dollar()) is introduced in the Money class.
This method reduces the direct use of the Dollar class in test code.

    static Dollar dollar(int amount) {
    return new Dollar(amount); }

This piece of code is a factory method
defined within the Money class that creates and returns an instance of the Dollar class.
The method takes an amount parameter, creates a new Dollar object with this amount, and returns it.
For example,
when Money.dollar(5) is called,
this method creates a Dollar object with 5 units of currency and returns this object.

    public void testMultiplication() {
    Money five = Money.dollar(5);
    assertEquals(Money.dollar(10), five.times(2));
    assertEquals(Money.dollar(15), five.times(3));
    }

A factory method is a design pattern in object-oriented programming 
that provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object 
that will be created. Instead of using the new keyword to instantiate objects directly, 
the factory method is called to obtain an instance. 
This method encapsulates the creation process of objects, 
which can enhance code modularity and encapsulation, and can help to manage 
and reduce dependencies in the system.

Purpose of Factory Methods
The primary purpose of introducing a factory method like Money.dollar() in your example is to abstract the process of object creation, thereby reducing direct coupling between classes and their clients (in this case, the test code). Instead of test code or other parts of your application knowing about the specifics of Dollar or Franc object creation, they only interact with the Money superclass.

How It Works in the Given Context
In the given scenario, Money.dollar() acts as a factory method. Here's what makes it a factory method:

Abstraction of Creation Logic: 
The factory method abstracts the instantiation logic. 
The caller does not need to know about the concrete class (Dollar) that's being instantiated. 
It just needs to know that it's getting a Money object back.

Consistency and Reusability: 
The method ensures that object creation is consistent and can be reused across the application. 
For instance, every part of the code that needs a new Dollar instance will go through this factory method, 
centralizing the creation logic and making changes to object creation easier to manage.

Reduced Dependency: 
By reducing direct instantiation of Dollar in various parts of your application, especially in test code, you reduce dependency on the specific implementation of currency classes. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain or extend. For example, if the implementation details of Dollar change, or if additional setup steps are required when creating a Dollar, only the factory method needs to be updated.
Example from Your Code
In the test method testMultiplication(), the use of Money.dollar(5) to create a Money object instead of directly creating a Dollar object has several benefits:

Decouples the test code from the concrete implementation of currencies: 
The test code does not need to change if the instantiation of Dollar or another subclass changes.
Simplifies the test code: The test code focuses on testing behavior rather than 
the specifics of object construction.

Enhances flexibility: 
If later you need a different kind of Money object under certain conditions, 
you can modify the factory method to instantiate a different subclass of Money 
without altering any code that uses this method.

    public void testMultiplication() {
    Money five = Money.dollar(5); // Creates a Money object, hiding the instantiation of Dollar
    assertEquals(Money.dollar(10), five.times(2));
    assertEquals(Money.dollar(15), five.times(3));
    }
This approach aligns with principles of good software design 
by promoting loose coupling and high cohesion, making the system more robust, adaptable, and easier to test.

###

Okay, we would be one step closer to eliminating the subclasses 
if there were fewer references to the subclasses directly. 
We can introduce a factory method in Money that returns a Dollar. 
We would use it like this: 

    public void testMultiplication() {
    Dollar five = Money.dollar(5); 
    assertEquals(new Dollar(10), five.times(2)); 
    assertEquals(new Dollar(15), five.times(3)); } 

The implementation creates and returns a Dollar: 

    Money static Dollar dollar(int amount) { return new Dollar(amount); }

But we want references to Dollars to disappear, 
so we need to change the declaration in the test: 

    public void testMultiplication() { 
    Money five = Money.dollar(5); 
    assertEquals(new Dollar(10), five.times(2)); 
    assertEquals(new Dollar(15), five.times(3)); }

When the author mentions "The implementation creates and returns a Dollar," he is referring to the operation performed by the Money.dollar() factory method. This method is defined as a static method within the Money class and creates and returns a Dollar object. The implementation of this method in the author's discussed code block looks like this:

java
Copy code
public static Money dollar(int amount) {
return new Dollar(amount);
}
This piece of code is a factory method 
defined within the Money class that creates and returns an instance of the Dollar class. 
The method takes an amount parameter, creates a new Dollar object with this amount, and returns it. 
For example, 
when Money.dollar(5) is called, 
this method creates a Dollar object with 5 units of currency and returns this object.

This structure is also used within tests, 
but the phrase "creates and returns a Dollar" specifically refers 
to the implementation of the Money.dollar() method. 
The usage of this method in a test might look like this:


    public void testMultiplication() {
    Money five = Money.dollar(5);
    assertEquals(new Dollar(10), five.times(2));
    assertEquals(new Dollar(15), five.times(3));
    }
Here, Money.dollar(5) is called to create a Dollar type Money object, 
which is assigned to the five variable. 
Then, multiplication operations like five.times(2) and five.times(3) are performed, 
and the results are compared with expected values (new Dollar(10) and new Dollar(15)).

So, the author's statement points to the location and functionality of the Money.dollar() method 
within the Money class, and this method is used in tests to perform various validations.
