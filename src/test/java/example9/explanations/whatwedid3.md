the refactoring process:

1. Improving the times() Method
   The author addresses the times() method similarly defined in both the Franc and Dollar classes 
by updating it to return a Money type object for both classes. 
This step aims to increase the consistency in method signatures and reduce code duplication.


    Franc Money times(int multiplier) { return new Franc(amount * multiplier); }
    Dollar Money times(int multiplier) { return new Dollar(amount * multiplier); }

2. Simplifying the Class Hierarchy
   The author notes that the Franc and Dollar classes are not doing enough work 
to justify their existence. Therefore, the goal is to eliminate these subclasses. 
However, for an effective demonstration of TDD, the author prefers not to do this in one big step.

3. Introducing a Factory Method
   To reduce direct references to subclasses, 
a factory method (Money.dollar()) is introduced in the Money class. 
This method reduces the direct use of the Dollar class in test code.


    public void testMultiplication() {
    Money five = Money.dollar(5);
    assertEquals(Money.dollar(10), five.times(2));
    assertEquals(Money.dollar(15), five.times(3));
    }
4. Abstracting the Money Class
   The Money class is made abstract (abstract class Money) and the times() method is 
declared in this abstract class (abstract Money times(int multiplier);), 
making the class hierarchy more flexible.

5. Increasing the Independence of Test Code
   By making the test code independent of the existence of subclasses, 
the validity of the tests is preserved even if these classes are removed in the future. 
This makes the code more modular and maintainable.

6. Introducing a Similar Factory Method for Franc
A similar factory method (Money.franc()) is introduced for Franc, limiting the use of Franc.


     public void testFrancMultiplication() {
     Money five = Money.franc(5);
     assertEquals(Money.franc(10), five.times(2));
     assertEquals(Money.franc(15), five.times(3));
      }

7. Reviewing the Tests
   The author notices that some tests have become redundant and could be removed, 
but does not act immediately. 
In particular, it's noted that the testFrancMultiplication test is 
testing the same logic as the test for Dollar multiplication, hence it could be unnecessary.

8. Reducing Direct References to Subclasses
"Reducing direct references to subclasses" refers to reducing references to specific subclass types 
like Dollar or Franc within the code. 
This increases the flexibility and sustainability of the code 
as changes in these classes will require fewer adjustments elsewhere in the code, 
making the overall structure more general and modular. Here’s an example:

    Previous Approach:

    Dollar five = new Dollar(5);  // Direct dependency on the Dollar class

Using the Factory Method:

    Money five = Money.dollar(5);  // Access through the Money type, class detail hidden
With this change, if the structure of the Dollar class changes, 
there's no need to alter other parts of the code outside the factory method. 
All changes can be managed within the Money.dollar() method.

9. Reducing Direct Use of the Dollar Class in Test Code
   Reducing the direct use of the Dollar class in test code makes the tests less dependent on specifics, 
thus changes in the Dollar class won't directly affect the test code. 
This makes the tests more robust and flexible. Here’s an example:

Previous Test Code:

        public void testMultiplication() {
        Dollar five = new Dollar(5);  // Direct dependency on the Dollar class
        assertEquals(new Dollar(10), five.times(2));
        assertEquals(new Dollar(15), five.times(3));
        }

Test Code Using Factory Method:

        public void testMultiplication() {
        Money five = Money.dollar(5);  // Dollar class details hidden
        assertEquals(Money.dollar(10), five.times(2));
        assertEquals(Money.dollar(15), five.times(3));
        }
In this case, by using Money.dollar(), 
we eliminate the direct link to the Dollar class. 
If changes are made to the Dollar class, there is no need to modify the tests.
